This project allows to automatically animate logos in SVG format using machine learning.

Its functionality includes:

* Extract SVG information, e.g., size, position, color
* Get SVG embeddings of logos by using deepSVG's hierarchical generative network
* Automatically animate logos using two different approaches: Genetic algorithm and entmoot optimizer

The project started in November 2020 as a Masters Team Project at the University of Mannheim.
